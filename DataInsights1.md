## Using Crowdsourcing and Deep Learning to Map Human Settlements

A challenge the development community and researchers tend to face is how to create accurate maps to use in their research in places they <br/>
are working that have few or unreliable maps. In recent times, due to the ever growing popularity and possibility of machine learning and artificial <br />
intelligence -- deep learning to be exact --, there is on going work in trying to combine various machine learning methods or algorithms <br/>
to try and solve the problem of unreliable maps in certain areas or corners of the world. The approach to the problem seeks to combine multiple layers <br/>
of data used for recursive learning and data collected from volunteers and solcial media platforms. This fusion of crowdsourcing and machine learning is the answer <br/>
to help mitigate the difficulties researchers face in the field when doing research on human settlement.

One approach that has stood out in a quest to find a solution to this challenge is DeepVGI (Deep Learning with Volunteered Geographic Information), "a classification method using <br/>
multi-layer recursive learning, and crowdsourcing from geo-tagged images on MapSwipe, a popular map crowdsourcing app." Furthermore, OpenStreetMAp and satelitte imagery is then used to fill in <br/>
key gaps for areas that can't be easily identified through images. Crowdsourcing also helps the features not easily identified to be validated, since the data <br/>
is obtain from members living in or near these communities.

Another approach has also employed the use of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) -- is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery -- <br/>
in combination with geo-tagged filed photographs crowdsourced from various sites to improve land classfication. So, how does this approach all work? CNNs algorithms are used to extract <br/>
the imagery and a multinomial logistic regression -- "A classification algorithm same like the logistic regression for binary classification. Whereas in <br/>
logistic regression for binary classification the classification task is to predict the target class which is of binary type. Like Yes/NO, 0/1, Male/Female. <br/>
When it comes to multinomial logistic regression the idea is to use the logistic regression techniques to predict the target class (more than 2 target classes)." -- <br/>
to classify the identified features. What's super cool about this is that apparently, "recent research has also suggested that we are at the point where crowdsourced <br/>
photographs or street imagery could now potentially take place of high resolution social data gathered using traditional survey methods. In such cases, photographs alone could, <br/>
to a high degree of accuracy, be trained using deep neural network models that allow images to be associated with different levels of environmental and health inequalities."<br/>
This could lead to a whole set of possibilities, since we could start using just images to do time consuming work and possibly even get rid of some of the groundwork stuff such as <br/>
door to door visits. Applying machine learning to things could even lead us to identify things that we could not even spot or were not even looking out for before.
