## Using Crowdsourcing and Deep Learning to Map Human Settlements

A challenge the development community and researchers tend to face is how to create accurate maps to use in their research in places they are working that have few or unreliable maps. In recent times, due to the ever growing popularity and possibility of machine learning and artificial intelligence -- deep learning to be exact --, there is on going work in trying to combine various machine learning methods or algorithms to try and solve the problem of unreliable maps in certain areas or corners of the world. The approach to the problem seeks to combine multiple layers of data used for recursive learning and data collected from volunteers and social media platforms. This fusion of crowdsourcing and machine learning is the answer to help mitigate the difficulties researchers face in the field when doing research on human settlements. <br/>

One approach that has stood out in a quest to find a solution to this challenge is DeepVGI (Deep Learning with Volunteered Geographic Information), "a classification method using multi-layer recursive learning, and crowdsourcing from geo-tagged images on MapSwipe, a popular map crowdsourcing app." Furthermore, OpenStreetMap and satelitte imagery is then used to fill in key gaps for areas that can't be easily identified through images. Crowdsourcing also helps the features not easily identified to be validated, since the data is obtained from members living in or near these communities.<br/>

Another approach has also employed the use of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) -- is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery -- in combination with geo-tagged filed photographs crowdsourced from various sites to improve land classfication. So, how does this approach all work? CNNs algorithms are used to extract the images and a multinomial logistic regression -- "A classification algorithm same like the logistic regression for binary classification. Whereas in logistic regression for binary classification the classification task is to predict the target class which is of binary type. Like Yes/NO, 0/1, Male/Female. When it comes to multinomial logistic regression the idea is to use the logistic regression techniques to predict the target class (more than 2 target classes)." -- to classify the identified features. What's super cool about this is that apparently, "recent research has also suggested that we are at the point where crowdsourced photographs or street imagery could now potentially take place of high resolution social data gathered using traditional survey methods. In such cases, photographs alone could, to a high degree of accuracy, be trained using deep neural network models that allow images to be associated with different levels of environmental and health inequalities."<br/>

This could lead to a whole set of possibilities, since we could start using just images to do time consuming work and possibly even get rid of some of the groundwork stuff such as <br/>
door to door visits. Applying machine learning to things could even lead us to identify things that we could not even spot or were not even looking out for before.
