# Data Science Knowledge Creation
## What at all is Agent Based Modeling?
From my previous experience with Agent Based Modeling in a Simulations class and the Agent Based Modeling class this semester, Agent Based Modeling can be summed up as a way of observing systems that focuses on the individual active components of that system. With Agent Based Modeling, actions of agents - the individuals in the system being observed - in our models can be modeled or predicted based on data collected on the agents in the system being observed, such as household data, travel data etc. basically anything relevant to the system being observed. Agent Based Modeling can be termed as a mindset. It is more than a technology. This mindset involves being able to describe whatever system we are looking at from the perspective of its constituent units [Bonabeau 2002]. Agent Based Modeling is well suited to modeling systems with heterogeneous, autonomous and proactive actors, such as human-centered systems, however, I have seen it also used to model the flocking behaviour or movement of birds.
Agent Based Modeling allows us to capture results from interactions of individual entities that lead to various phenomena. Aristotle I believe said it best when he said, "The whole is more than the sum of its parts." This is why Agent Based Modeling is such a powerful tool. It allows us to observe how the interactions of various parts or individuals of the system come together to contribute to the current system. Companies these days even use it to model how their consumers will react to products they will be putting out based on various factors. With the huge amount of data that has been amassed in the world today and the whole Big Data wave, I believe Data Science with the use of Agent Based Modeling is a powerful way to analyze and put these large sums of data to proper work or use. The possibilities of Agent Based Modeling are endless. It can serve as a much less cost effective way if computational power is excluded, for us to understand various human behaviours, and even go so far as to be able to forecast some human scenarios based on the models we generate from certain systems, and even as a way for us to make more better and rational decisions based on what we seek to achieve.

## How Can Agent Based Modeling Be Beneficial to Society?
To better describe how Agent Based Modeling can help us observe systems and make more rational decisions, I would like to use an example from current times. 
So, I was studying abroad at the University of Nottingham when the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and I sadly had to come home. On my flight home, I saw a great number of people in full rubber onesies and masks almost like hazmat suits because they were trying to avoid catching the COVID-19 virus in any way possible. You couldn’t really blame these people. The queues at airports to get through checks can sometimes be long, annoying, and congested. As such it is almost impossible sometimes for people not to get into your personal bubble while you are walking around or waiting in line. 
Thinking about all those times I’ve had to stand in long airport queues and the COVID-19 pandemic now, I believe Agent Based Modeling can be a way to solve the problem of long and congested queues to get through customs or through the airport to your plane. A way to approach the problem would be to use data collected by airports over the years on the customers that go in and out of their airports. I am sure somewhere in the every major airport's database, they have some sort of information about the number of people that go through their airports, what are the peak times in the airport when there is a large number of people, number of airport workers on the floor at each time, and any other persistent factors in airports that contribute to long queues and long wait times. 
With all this data, we can model or simulate the agents in the system - airport in this case - and with that be able to predict how best to control the flow of people within the airport or how many people get through customs at a time, in order to allow smooth movement and also help minimize contact between people in airports to prevent or lower the spread of COVID-19 during travel in airports.

## Concerns
One thing that concerns me most is the use of such methods for nefarious purposes. If you have watched the Social Dilemma documentary on Netflix, you’ll know how various social media companies use the data they glean from us to make us more addicted to their social media platforms. Think of it as every single user on a social media platform as an avatar within some system, and the data we produce on these social media sites are the factors used in the system to get better at predicting how we would react to certain things and how to make us much more addicted to these platforms. So imagine some greedy company with the resources and access to such tools creating an Agent Based Model of everyone who uses their platform, then engineering that to test a simulation on how to get their users addicted and using say A/B testing, slowly roll out various things they observe in the system of their Agent Based Model in order to test the effectiveness of it on users, and then use the data obtained from these tests to better fine tune their model to get better and better at making us addicted. We are already addicted to our social media and phones as of now, so imagine years from now when we have perfected Agent Based Modeling. This makes me fear a good amount for the future

## Major Obstacles
One major obstacle for Agent Based Modeling is computational power, because we are transmitting more and more data by the second and the minute across the world, so it will get harder and harder to process all that data or run models on them. We as a society know the data we are producing is getting larger day in day out, so I feel it is imperative that we also devote resources to creating hardware that can handle the demand or such large quantities of data.

## The Good
Agent Based Modeling when used effectively and properly will help us understand and predict many human behaviors and systems. It has the capacity for extreme good if properly applied and could benefit the human race in various ways. It could give insight into the intricacies of various human systems, it could provide the framework for testing various strategies, and it could give further insight into emergent phenomena.
