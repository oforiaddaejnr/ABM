This DHS report is for Sierra Leone 2013
- Data collection took place from 29 June 2016 to 4 August 2016
- Based  on  a  nationally  representative  sample  of  13,006  households  and  16,500  completed  interviews  of  women,  the  main  objectives  of  the  2013  SLDHS  were  to  provide  up-to-date  information  on  fertility  and  childhood  mortality  levels;  fertility  preferences;  awareness,  approval,  and  use  of  family  planning  methods;  maternal  and  child  health;  knowledge  and  attitudes towards HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STI); and prevalence of HIV/AIDS. All women age 15-49 who slept in the selected households the night before the survey were eligible for the survey.  The  survey  results  are  representative  for  the  country  as  a  whole,  for  the  urban  and  rural  areas  separately, for each of the four geographical regions, and for each of the 14 administrative districts. 
- Apart from the women’s survey, a survey among men was conducted in one of every two households selected  for  the  women’s  survey.  All  men  age  15-59  who  slept  in  the  households  selected  for  the  men’s  survey were interviewed with the Man’s Questionnaire. All eligible men age 15-59 and all eligible women age 15-49 in the households selected for men’s survey were eligible for HIV testing.  
- The sample for the 2013 SLDHS was a stratified sample selected in two stages from the 2004 census frame. Stratification was achieved by separating each district into urban and rural areas. The West Urban Area  has  only  urban  areas.  In  total,  27  sampling  strata  had  been  constructed.  Samples  had  been  selected  independently in each stratum, by a two-stage selection process. By sorting the sampling frame according to administrative orders and by using a probability proportional to size selection at the first stage’s sampling, an implicit stratification and proportional allocation would have been achieved at each of the administrative levels.
