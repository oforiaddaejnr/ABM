## Plotting First ADM in R - Sierra Leone
This was my first plot in R. I combined ADM0, ADM1, and ADM2 of Sierra Leone to create the plot below.

## Plotting Populous District in Sierra Leone
This challenge involved filtering the Sierra Leone ADM1 to target a specific region. In this case, the district was the West Urban region which is shaded in red, and happens to also be where the capital of Sierra Leone, Freetown is located - this conclusion was arrived at by looking up Sierra Leone districts by population, which lead me to a Wikipedia article with 2015 census info, that listed West Urban as the most populous.

## Producing Detailed Map of More Densely Populated Areas
I filtered the top 3 most populous regions in Sierra Leone - also based on info obtained from the Wikipedia article I talked about above.
